Pirate Intelligent Agent – Project Two
Overview

This project implements a reinforcement learning–based pirate intelligent agent. The goal of the agent is to navigate an environment and learn to find treasure efficiently through trial and error. The project demonstrates how reinforcement learning concepts can be applied to problem solving, decision-making, and adaptive behavior.

Given Code

The starter code provided included:
Environment setup for the pirate world (map, treasure locations, actions, and rewards).

Functions to track the state of the agent and apply rules of the environment.

A basic structure to integrate an agent into the simulation.

My Contributions

I created:
The intelligent agent’s decision-making logic.

Reinforcement learning functions for action selection, reward tracking, and policy updates.

Testing and tuning of parameters (learning rate, discount factor, exploration/exploitation balance).

Iterative improvements to help the agent find treasure more efficiently over time.

How to Run:
Open the Jupyter Notebook (pirate_agent.ipynb).

Run the cells in order to initialize the environment and train the agent.

Watch the agent’s performance improve across episodes as it learns to maximize rewards.

Learning Connections: 
This project connects to the larger field of computer science by showing how intelligent agents can model human-style problem-solving. It highlights reinforcement learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that is widely applied in robotics, recommendation systems, and game AI.

Ethical Considerations:
When developing intelligent systems, it is important to:

Ensure fairness and avoid reinforcing bias in decision-making.

Protect user privacy and data.

Build systems that are transparent and reliable.

Consider the real-world impact of deploying AI solutions.
