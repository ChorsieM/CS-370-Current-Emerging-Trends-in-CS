Pirate Intelligent Agent – Project Two
For this project, I was given starter code that set up the environment for the pirate intelligent agent. The provided code included the structure for the agent’s interactions, the rules of the environment, and some of the basic functions to track movement, actions, and rewards. From there, I created the code that made the agent “intelligent.” I wrote the logic for the agent to learn from its environment using reinforcement learning concepts, tested different parameters, and modified decision-making strategies so the agent could improve its ability to find treasure efficiently over time.

Connecting to the Larger Field of Computer Science

Computer scientists solve problems by designing, testing, and improving systems that use logic and computation. Their work matters because it powers nearly every part of modern life—from healthcare and security to communication and entertainment. In this project, I practiced what computer scientists do every day: I took a real-world style problem, broke it into smaller steps, and built code to automate learning and decision-making.

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first analyzing the requirements, then experimenting with potential solutions, and finally refining my code based on testing and feedback. This mindset of breaking problems down and iterating until I find an efficient solution is central to the field.

Ethical Responsibilities

Working on intelligent agents reminded me that ethical responsibility is just as important as technical skill. As a computer scientist, I owe it to the end user to create systems that are safe, transparent, and reliable. I also owe it to the organization to write code that is maintainable, secure, and honest about its limitations. AI systems in particular must be built with fairness, accuracy, and privacy in mind so they don’t harm users or reinforce bias.
